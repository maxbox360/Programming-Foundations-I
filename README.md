# Programming-Foundations-I

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to help my C++ and github skills by working
on homeworks provided by John Gauch from the University of Arkansas. 

These are mini-programming challenges for myself. Some of these that took over
two weeks to do when first starting now take me mere hour(s).
